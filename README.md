## Why we made it:
As an individual, we like to think we know how others see us. However, the way others see us is not usually how we see ourselves. Our app is meant to give the individual a different but light hearted look into themselves so that they may have a alternate idea of how the world perceives them.   

## The problem we hope to solve:
Our app was created with the idea that an individual can and will benefit from an alternate view of themselves. 

## Who is the app designed for:
Everyone.
